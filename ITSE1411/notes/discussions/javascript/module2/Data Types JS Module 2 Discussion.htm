      <li>JavaScript Data Types
              <ul>
                <li>Variables are assigned values.  There are five "primitive" types of values in JavaScript that the variables represent.
                    A primitive type holds only one value.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Number - numbers are of two different types:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Integers - whole numbers with no decimal points.</li>
                        <li>Float numbers - numbers with a decimal point.</li>
                      </ul></li>
                    <li>Boolean - a logical value that is either true or false.</li>
                    <li>String - text.</li>
                    <li>Undefined - a variable that has been declared but has not been defined (assigned a value).</li>
                    <li>Null - an empty value.  (In JavaScript you actually assign the reserved word "null".)  For example:<br />
                        var myName = "null";</li>
                  </ul></li>
                <li>JavaScript is loosely typed meaning that a variable can be assigned different types.
                    For example you can declare a variable and assign it different types of data:<br />
                    var myVariable = "Hello World";<br />
                    myVariable = 6</li>
              </ul></li>
      <li>Numeric data types
            <ul>
                  <li>An integer is a number that does not have a decimal point.  It can be either
                      positive or negative.</li>
                  <li>A floating-point number is a number that has a decimal point.  It can be either
                      positive or negative.  When a floating-point is a very large number (or has a large
                      number of decimal places), the floating-point number is represented in scientific
                      notation.  The number 200,000,000,000.0 is the same as the number 2.0e11</li>
            </ul></li>
      <li>Boolean values
            <ul>
                  <li>A Boolean value is a value with the value of true or false.  Do not use quotes around
                      the word true or false.  Some programming languages use 0 for false and 1 for true.
                      (A handy way to remember that 0 is false is 0 come before 1, and alphabetically
                      'f' comes before 't'.)  </li>
            </ul></li>
      <li>Working with strings
            <ul>
                  <li>A string contains 0 or more characters.</li>
                  <li>A string is contained in either a single or double quotation (but they must match).</li>
                  <li>A zero length string is called an empty string.  To assign a string variable the value
                      of an empty string the syntax is:<pre>
                        var someVariable = "";</pre></li>
                  <li>An empty string is not the same as a null string (which has the value null) or
                      an undefined string (a string that has not been assigned a value).</li>
                  <li>Since quotes (either single or double) are used to contain a literal string, to
                      display either single or double quotes as part of the string takes some effort.
                      <ul>
                        <li>Use single quotes to encase double quotes.</li>
                        <li>Use double quotes to encase single quotes.</li>
                      </ul></li>
                  <li>The '+' operator is used in a string for concatenation (combining two strings).
                       You can also use the '+=' operator which will be explained in the expression
                       discussion with compound operators.</li>
                  <li>Escape characters and sequences
                        <ul>
                              <li>The escape character in JavaScript is the backslash '\'</li>
                              <li>Quotations work in pairs to open and close strings.  To use a
                                  single quotation (for example writing a possessive word or a contraction)
                                  use an escape character to show the following letter has a special
                                  purpose.  The escape character and an apostrophe example is<pre>
      can\'t</pre>which displays<pre>
      can't</pre></li>
                              
                        </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
