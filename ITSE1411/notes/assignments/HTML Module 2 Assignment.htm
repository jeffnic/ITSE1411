          <li>Begin your Portfolio
             <ul>
                  <li>When you complete this course, you should have a portfolio of projects that you can show a prospective employer
                      what you can do.  However, there will be modifications made to the textbook requirements to include JavaScript
                      as it applies to each JavaScript concept.  You may learn as you work on your site, that you would like to change the topic.
                      This will create additional work for you, so try very hard to pick a topic that interests you.  Or, consider
                      creating a site for an organization that you belong to.  It will be impressive if you can show an actual site
                      that is being used in your portfolio.</li>
                  <li>Start Web Project Case Study on pages 98 and 99 of your Design Text.  You are writing these steps using a text editor.  You
                      are not writing these steps in HTML.
                      <ol>
                        <li>Please write for project topic approval using bullet format to match the bullet format in step 1.  This can be
                            very concise.  Modifications are usually made as more thought is put into a site.  It doesn't matter if the bullet is numbered or not.  The best
                            way to get approval is to upload your document to the web and link to it from your index page.  However, I will accept an attachment in an email.</li>
                        <li>Think about step 2 but you do not have to send me anything yet for this step.  Since we haven't actually covered that
                            material, it is really difficult to solidify that now.</li>
                        <li>For step 3, you do not have to create a sophisticated page.
                            See <a href="pacific.htm"></a>.
                            You do not have to use HTML for this step.  Any text editor will do just as long as I can figure out what your
                            tentative site map will look like.</li>
                        <li>You are not restricted to use the page layout composition shown in Figure 3.30 on pages 87,
                            but you are welcome to use it.
                            Again, you do not have to have professional skills.  Something equivalent to the look of Pacific Trails Resort page
                            is good enough. </li>
                        <li>For step 5, you may use your pacific.htm page you created in Module 1 for reference.  Create the home page for your
                            project.  Name your page home.htm.</li>
                      </ol></li>
                  <li>For Chapter 4, continue working on your home.htm page of your Web Project Case Study.
                     <ol>
                        <li>Follow page 123 - 125, Focus on Web Design, steps c. and d. except apply to your home.htm page.</li>
                     </ol></li>
                  <li>For Chapter 5, continue working on your home.htm page of your Web Project Case Study.
                     <ol>
                        <li>Add an image as the background to the title of your page (This is not the title tag; This is an H tag). </li>
                        <li>Add a color to the background of your links below your title. (Or wherever you have your navigation links.)</li>
                        <li>Add an image to your page to add interest.  Remember copyrights quite often are lenient for educational purposes, but if
                            you are using an image for your portfolio, it will not be considered educational after the semester is over.  Be
                            very careful that you do not use copyrighted images because you could be sued.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>For Chapter 9, create a new page for your Web Project Case Study.
                      <ol>
                        <li>Start your page using the templateHTML.htm page.  Save as schedule.htm (or another appropriate name).</li>
                        <li>Your table subject should apply to the theme of your project.  One idea is a volunteer or employee schedule.</li>
                        <li>Your page should show a table similar to Figure 9.15 on page 282.  You should create an external css page that blends with your
                            CSS used on your home page (a site should have a consistent look, but your homepage can have some differences especially the
                            size of the title and the navigation.</li>
                        <li>Your table must use different background colors for every other row, and some columns should be centered and some
                            columns should not be centered.</li>
                        <li>Update your navigation on your home page to link to your schedule.htm page.  Update your schedule.htm page navigation
                            to link to your home.htm page.</li>
                        </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Upload the module2 folder containing all files used in your module2 folder to your site.</li>
                  <li>Using http, go to cois-linux.austincc.edu/~login/module2/home.htm
                      (where login is the login name posted in Blackboard).  Test that your
                      home.htm page validates in both HTML5 and CSS.</li>
                  <li>If there are any errors, correct, reupload, and test.</li>
                  <li>Test your schedule.htm page.</li>
                  <li>Email jscholl@austincc.edu for grading.</li>
             </ul></li>
                     <li>Student examples (you are not to copy the style or layout of student examples, these just show you what other students have done)
