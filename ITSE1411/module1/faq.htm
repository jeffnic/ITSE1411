    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
<dl>
    <dt><strong>How are the Bud Vases made?</strong></dt>
        <dd>We select solid heart cedar and turn them round on a wood lathe. They are then bored and a special plastic sleeve is inserted into the hole to hold water.</dd>
    <dt><br><strong>How long will my order take?</strong></dt>
        <dd>This depends on the size of the order and our current backlog. Typically orders ship in 2 to 4 weeks. Contact us if you need them sooner.</dd>
    <dt><br><strong>What kind of oil should I get for the oil candles?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Look for oil that is clean burning and smoke free. We've always had good luck with the Walmart brand.</dd>
    <dt><br><strong>Where do you find the fence posts?</strong></dt>
        <dd>We've developed a relationship with several ranchers in Central Texas who are more than happy to sell us their used barbed-wire fence posts.</dd>
