<p>
    Fencepost Vases opened for business in early 2004. It's grown exponentially since then, and has
    become the country's largest wholesale manufacturer of bud vases. All products are made from recycled
    barbed-wire fence posts. Most times the posts have aged 50 years or more and are full of character.
